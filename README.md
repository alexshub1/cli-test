# CLI Test

This excercise has been created to test out the command line interface using common cli commands. They only contain small txt files so there is no code to view.
This has mainly been a practice session using git and GitHub to push the files to a local repository and then to a GitHub repo.

Please use this link to view the result of the exercise which is hosted on GitHub Pages.
