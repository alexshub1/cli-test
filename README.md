# CLI Test

This excercise has been created to test out the command line interface using common cli commands. They only contain small txt files so there is no code to view.

This has been a practice session using git commands to create, edit and manipulate files and folders, then using git and GitHub to push the 
files to a local repository and then to a GitHub repo.
